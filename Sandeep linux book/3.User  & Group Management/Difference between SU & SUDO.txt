Difference between SU & SUDO --- BY CHATGPT
===========================================================================================================================

The terms su and sudo are both used in Unix-like operating systems to execute commands with elevated privileges, but they serve different purposes and have distinct behaviors:

su (Substitute User)
======================
Purpose: su stands for "substitute user" or "switch user." It allows a user to assume the identity of another user within the system, typically the root user.
Usage:
su without any arguments switches to the root user and requires the root password.
su <username> switches to the specified user and requires the password for that user.
Environment: By default, su opens a new shell with the target user's environment. Using su - or su --login initiates a login shell and simulates a full login, including loading the target user's environment variables.
Session: Once su is executed, you remain in the new user's session until you explicitly log out by typing exit or pressing Ctrl-D.

sudo (Superuser Do)
=========================
Purpose: sudo stands for "superuser do." It allows a permitted user to execute a single command as the superuser or another user, as specified in the sudoers configuration file.
Usage:
sudo <command> runs the specified command with elevated privileges.
Requires the current user's password, not the target user's password.
Configuration: The sudoers file (/etc/sudoers) specifies which users can run which commands as which users on which machines. This file allows fine-grained control over permissions.
Environment: By default, sudo preserves most of the calling user's environment variables but can be configured to use a more restricted environment.
Session: sudo runs a single command and then returns to the normal user's session. It does not switch the user session like su does.
Key Differences:
Authentication:
su requires the password of the target user.
sudo requires the password of the current user.
Scope:
su changes the entire user session.
sudo runs a single command with elevated privileges.
Configuration:
su has no specific configuration file for access control.
sudo uses the sudoers file to control access and permissions.
Practical Use Cases:
su: Useful for switching to another user entirely for a prolonged period, especially for administrative tasks that require frequent and varied commands.
sudo: Preferred for executing individual commands with elevated privileges, ensuring that the user only has temporary access to root privileges, thus reducing security risks.
Both tools are essential for system administration, but sudo is generally favored for its granular control and security features.
